## What happened today

Nanu saw a dinosaur documentary on TV and got super excited. He kept asking questions about dinosaurs for like 2 hours straight.

He wanted to know:
- Why did dinosaurs disappear?
- Can scientists bring them back?
- If they come back, can we keep one as a pet?

Then he said the funniest thing about riding a T-Rex to school. His logic was that nobody would bully him if he had a dinosaur. Can't argue with that actually 😄

He also drew a picture of himself sitting on top of a T-Rex with a school bag. It was hilarious.
