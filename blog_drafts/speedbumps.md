When I'm dropping my kid to school two days back he said the exact same words when I went fast over the speedbreaker, he calls it as speed bump

at first thought I thought its not true and stupid

but while retun - I realized that he is a genuis AND i'M STUPID AS DIDN'T UNDERSTOOD

If we go speed on the road, didn't apply breaks when speedbreaker/speedbump arrives, then it felt like big speed breaker, but if we slowed down then it won't show any effect which he said

I thought Wow - what a thought he had and I never think of this in my life

I means Dad, he means my Kid Nanu
